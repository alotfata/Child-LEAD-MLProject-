# Data attached 

Modelling spatial -temporal patten of housing with lead risk and children in poverty in between 2013-2020-
Data include whole cities of US, we can model seperately for major cities of US as LA, SF, NewYork, Chicago and Atlanta 

Ideas-
Stef:[Since its spatiotemporal data, maybe using geographical and temporaly weighted regression is one way to go? Ofcourse it depends on the nature of the data (i.e, do you have data per year?). You  could also consider to add some temporal function as a variable in a ML model. During my master thesis I had applied GWR per year (NDVI ~ rainfall) for a period of 8 years or so and had computed the temporal slope of all these local GWR results, which allowed us to see the change in spatial trends  (https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=OLTr-XYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=OLTr-XYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC), so that could be one way to go.]
